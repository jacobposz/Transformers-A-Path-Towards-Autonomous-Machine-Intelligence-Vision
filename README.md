# A Path Towards Autonomous Machine Intelligence

## Overview
### JEPA
In this paper, LeCun proposes how he thinks we should reach machine intelligence.

LeCun's proposal is centered around JEPA; a new architecture that LeCun proposes. As states by LeCun, "JEPA models learn high-level representations that capture the dependencies between two data points, such as two segments of video that follow each other. JEPA replaces contrastive learning with “regularized” techniques that can extract high-level latent features from the input and discard irrelevant information."

### Main contributions of the paper
As stated in the paper, the main contributions of this paper include:
1) an overall cognitive architecture in which all modules are differntiable and many of them are trainable
2) JEPA and Hierarchical JEPA: a non-generative architecture for predictive worl models that learn a hierarchy of representations
3)
